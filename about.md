# About

Welcome to the website for UVa's Puzzle Poetry group! 

This website was originally developed (and has been adapted from) a code base created by [Brad Pasanek](http://www.engl.virginia.edu/people/bmp7e) which was much improved by Timothy Schott and Lauren Johnson (who both contributed code and graphic design). The site was developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a slick, Ruby-infused flavor of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Jeremy Little invented the javascript sonnet puzzle. From the start, development efforts were greatly assisted by the [UVa Scholar's Lab](http://scholarslab.org/), particularly [Jeremy Boggs](http://scholarslab.org/people/jeremy-boggs/). 

### The Puzzle Project
The group is working to convert a sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets into pentomino puzzles. These will be laser cut from wood, acrylic, and other materials, and then assembled as an art-object titled _Increase_. Preparing the the puzzles requires finding ways to pack pentomino shapes into a sonnet-shaped frame. Working by hand, we've carved up several sonnets into a set of pentomino shapes but we hope to do better, finding all possible solutions to our sequence of sonnets, that is, all the ways that a given sonnet can be cut up into pentomino shapes.
