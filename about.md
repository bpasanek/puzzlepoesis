# About

Welcome to the website for UVa's Puzzle Poetry group. We're all about lasers, supercomputers, and prosody...

### Our Story

Over the summer of 2017, Neal Curtis and Brad Pasanek started scissoring poem-puzzles out of paper and sharing them with colleagues in the English department. Soon enough [Melissa Goldman](http://www.arch.virginia.edu/faculty/Melissa_Goldman) trained Neal to use the laser cutters in the Architecture School's Fab Lab and he cut our first sonnet from a sheet of dayglo orange acrylic. A group of faculty, staff, MFAs, grads and undergrads began to meet regularly in the semester that followed to read poems, discuss literary theory, fabricate a variety of poetry puzzles out of wood and colored plexiglass, and spec an online game. We're still at it and meet most Fridays at 1:30pm on the first floor of Wilson Hall. Let Brad or Neal know if you're interested in participating.

The [The Institute of Global Humanities & Culture](https://ihgc.as.virginia.edu) and the [Page-Barbour Committee](http://page-barbour-richard.virginia.edu/page-barbour-richards-committee) provided our startup funding and support. The group is now part of UVa's [Humanities Informatics Lab](http://http://ihgc.as.virginia.edu/humanities-informatics). Julie Gronlund at the [IHGC](https://ihgc.as.virginia.edu) has been especially attentive and supportive. We owe a special thank you to Chris Jessee of [Cardboard Safari](https://www.cardboardsafari.com) and [Antler Home](https://antlerhome.com); Chris has generously donated materials and shared his expertise. 

This website was originally developed (and has been adapted from) a code base created by [Brad Pasanek](http://www.engl.virginia.edu/people/bmp7e), but which was much improved and expanded by Timothy Schott. Lauren Johnson has contributed site and graphic design. [Katherine Donnally](http://scholarslab.org/people/katherine-donnally/) worked out the CSS for our collapsing puzzle navigation menu. The site was developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a slick, Ruby-infused flavor of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Jeremy Little invented our javascript sonnet puzzle. From the outset, development efforts were greatly assisted by the [UVa Scholar's Lab](http://scholarslab.org/), particularly [Jeremy Boggs](http://scholarslab.org/people/jeremy-boggs/).

### The Increase Puzzle Project
The group is working to convert a sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets into pentomino puzzles. These will be laser cut from wood, acrylic, and other materials, and then assembled as an art-object titled _Increase_. Preparing the the puzzles requires finding ways to pack pentomino shapes into a sonnet-shaped frame. Working by hand, we've carved up several sonnets into a set of pentomino shapes but we hope to do better, finding all possible solutions (under our constraints) to the sequence of sonnets, that is, all the ways that a given sonnet can be cut up into pentomino and tetromino shapes. 

With the help of [Clay Ford](http://data.library.virginia.edu/rds-staff/clay-ford/), Brad Pasanek has been processing sestets in R and matching them with solutions to the 6x10 pentomino [problem](https://isomerdesign.com/Pentomino/6x10/index.html). Matching octaves to a packed rectangle of pentominos and tetrominos has proved more elusive as sorting through solutions is much more computationally intense. Indeed, the effort has involved us with consultants from [The Scholars' Lab](http://scholarslab.org) ([Shane Lin](http://scholarslab.org/people/shane-lin/) and [Brandon Walsh](http://scholarslab.org/people/brandon-walsh/)) and Virginia's [Advanced Research Computing Services](https://arcs.virginia.edu). Jeremy Little, [Katherine Holcomb](https://arcs.virginia.edu/staff), [Jacalyn Huband](https://arcs.virginia.edu/staff), and [Karsten Siller](https://arcs.virginia.edu/staff) have all helped with getting our code to run on [Rivanna](https://arcs.virginia.edu/rivanna), U.Va.'s High Performance Computing system.

### Other Projects
The group has imagined and produced a variety of other puzzles in various media, some of which are collected as part of this site under the [Puzzles](./puzzles.html) rubric. This semester we are also collaborating with [Gavin Garner](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/gavin-garner) and U.Va.'s [Gizmologists](https://news.virginia.edu/content/student-gizmologists-engineer-unique-timepiece).
