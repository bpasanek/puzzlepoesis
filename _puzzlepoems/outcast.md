### Claude McKay, "Outcast"

![Sestet, McKay's "Outcast"](../images/Mckay-sestet.jpg)

We've found a Claude McKay sonnet that piecifies and have fabricated two sestet puzzles in bamboo. 

The poem is McKay's "Outcast," a sonnet that seems to thematize the misfitting of identity and form in its contrast of 
"forgotten songs" (lines 2 and 3) and the constraints of the English verse form. As an eighteenth-centuryist, I can't 
help but note what look like allusions to Phyllis Wheatley ("native clime") alongside the play of other "unheard melodies".

But the structuring volta is what our puzzle makes most plain--perhaps too patent. An English sonnet, a Jamaican-American poet. 
The poem divides sharply into a nostalgic octave and an alienated sestet, 
an African past and a Harlem Renaissance present. 

Read McKay's full sonnet below: 

**Outcast**  

For the dim regions whence my fathers came  
My spirit, bondaged by the body, longs.  
Words felt, but never heard, my lips would frame;  
My soul would sing forgotten jungle songs.  
I would go back to darkness and to peace,  
But the great western world holds me in fee,  
And I may never hope for full release  
While to its alien gods I bend my knee.  

Something in me is lost, forever lost,  
Some vital thing has gone out of my heart,  
And I must walk the way of life a ghost  
Among the sons of earth, a thing apart;  
For I was born, far from my native clime,  
Under the white manâ€™s menace, out of time.
