# Puzzle Poesis

This is the main git for UVa's Puzzle Poetry group.

This repository will eventually house code for solving poetry puzzles (polyomino puzzles) and related puzzle-poem games. Currently this readme file narrowly addresses a project involving Shakespeare's "procreation" sonnets (Sonnets 1 to 17). 

### The Puzzle Project
The group is working to create convert a sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets into pentomino puzzles. These will be laser cut from wood, acrylic, and other materials, and then assembled as an art-object titled _Increase_. Preparing the the puzzles requires finding ways to pack pentomino shapes into a sonnet-shaped frame. Working by hand, we've carved up several sonnets into a set of pentomino shapes but we hope to do better, finding all possible solutions to our sequence of sonnets, that is, all the ways that a given sonnet can be cut up into pentomino shapes.

For reference, the complete set of pentominoes appears below with the pieces labeled alphabetically:

### The Puzzle Solver: Overview

Pentomino puzzles can also be solved computationally, and therefore exhaustively. Katherine Holcomb has adapted and uploaded C++ code that leverages 4 different puzzle-solving algorithms (DLX, 2. MCH, EMCH, de Bruijn). Unpack the tarball polycube.tgz for code, modules, and makefiles.

Katherine includes the following instructions:
1. module load gcc/4.8.2  -- it *will not* link with the default 5.4.0 because boost was built with 4.8.2
2. module load boost (optional since I put full paths into the makefile, but will be required to run it to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
3. cd src
4. make

In one canonical pentomino puzzle, the 12 pentomino pieces are packed into a 6 x 10 grid. This 6 x 10 puzzle has been solved computationally and it is known that there are 2,339 ways to fit 12 pentominoes into a 6 x 10 grid. 

One of our first jobs is to rewrite this code to solve sonnet-shaped puzzles. In the case of sonnets, we have 14 x 10 grids (14 lines, 10 syllables per line). English majors may note that 6 x 10 is the shape of a sestet, the last six lines of a sonnet. Traditionally, the sestet provides an answer to the question posed in the first eight lines of the poem called the "octave." It may then be ideal (and cleverly meaningful) to pack the octave and sestet of our sonnets separately. Brad thinks below out loud about what this packing will entail. For one thing, most pieces will have to appear more than once (at least once in the sestet, then most or all will appear again in the octave, a few two or three times more). It would be most elegant to pack the octave with as many different shapes as will fit.

    
### Create New Puzzles
To create a new puzzle...

An empty sonnet (14 x 10 grid):

     L:stationary=*
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . . .

Again, we are treating poems as frames into which words are packed (a so-called packing puzzle). For the purposes of solving a sonnet, the words in the poem are assigned to pentomino shapes. A puzzle is solved when a set of 28 pentominoes have been packed into the frame, so that each  word in the poem is associated with a placed pentomino piece. In fact, a packed pentomino piece will gather at least one five syllable word--the "I" pentomino piece inserted horizontally is the right shape to do so--or at most five one-syllable words. 

Note, our solutions cannot divide words, which means there are constraints (represented below with question marks and hyphens) that our current modified pentomino solver has not yet been programmed to respect.
  
  Sonnet 2:

        . ?-? ?-? . ?-? . .
        . . . ?-? . . ?-? .
        . . . ?-?-? . . . .
        . . . ?-? . . . . .
        . ?-? . . . . ?-? .
        . . . ?-? . . ?-? .
        . . ?-? . . . ?-? .
        . . . ?-? . . ?-? .

        . . . ?-? . . . . .
        . . . . . . . . ?-?

 Sonnet 2:
 
 [1] "When forty winters shall besiege thy brow"          
 [2] "And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,"       
 [3] "Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,"         
 [4] "Will be a tattered weed of small worth held."       
 [5] "Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,"        
 [6] "Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,"          
 [7] "To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes"           
 [8] "Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise."    
 [9] "How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use"     
[10] "If thou couldst answer \"This fair child of mine"   
[11] "Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,\""       
[12] "Proving his beauty by succession thine."            
[13] "  This were to be new made when thou art old"       
[14] "  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold."

How to rewrite the C code? A good question! The hyphenated positions in the grid above should, Brad thinks, be filled first in any revised walk-back routine. That is, the first pentominoes should be placed over these squares in such a way that no piece covers only part of a poem position marked with a ?-?, ?-?-?, etc. Performance might be optimized if the partially packed puzzle is then checked for areas that won't fit a pentomino. Alternately, brute packing of shapes can continue until the solver fails and has to back up and start again.

Each of the 17 sonnets has a different set of constraints on pentomino placement and word-division. It may well be that there are sonnets that do not have solutions.

An extra headache: 7 sonnets (sonnets 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17) have lines in them that have more than ten syllables. We'll need to adjust these lines by hand (eliding syllables or crowding them) before pursuing scripted solutions.
