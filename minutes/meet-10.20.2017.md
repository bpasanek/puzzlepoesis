### Some notes:

Planning for The Sonnet Gamesâ„¢  
Scheduled for Wednesday night, 11/1. To be announced in ENGL 3810. Advertised through TA sections, by Fowler, by ESA, and department list serves.  

Figuring out what this looks like (David suggests we do a trial run the night before)  
Teams to sign up beforehand. Teams of 3 or 4.   
Two main events: The first with two heats (a whole sonnet) and then just the sestet of that poem. The second, head-to-head event a different sestet. Prizes for fastest sonnet, fastest sestet, and then for winner of the head-to-head competition.
To be filmed: Abigail Johnson has volunteered to do videography.  
We may want more cameras from Clemons, to make it look more like a sports event.  
(Can we get referee jerseys?)  

Going forward: things to read and discuss. Fish on stylometrics, Richards on Jakobson, Rothstein on puzzles.  
After this event, we will be working on individual projects. Soliciting project proposals.   
David Hall thinks Student Gaming will be accepting design proposals around 1/26. We'll want to be ready! 
Jeremy Little showed off initial work in javascript on an in-browser sonnet solving game. Awesome!  

### To Do:
1. Cut Puzzles on Sunday (email to recruit cutters)
2. Brad to reserve a room: Bryan Hall or Mem Gym
3. Brad and Neal both to nudge Fowler to talk it up.
