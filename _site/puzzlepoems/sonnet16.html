<p>Over the summer Neal Curtis and Brad Pasanek began cutting poem puzzles out of paper. Shown above is our first puzzle realized in a sturdier material. The puzzle was etched onto orange acrylic and sliced up by Neal Curtis, who was making good on his UVa A-School <a href="http://makergrounds.virginia.edu/fablab.html">Fab Lab</a> training with the laser cutter. Neal chose Shakespeare’s Sonnet 16, worked out the structure on graph paper, transposed his design in Illustrator, and then on July 27, cut the puzzle from a scrap piece of acrylic that he found in the Fab Lab.</p>

<p>The poem is shown below, in pieces, its “lines unset.”</p>
