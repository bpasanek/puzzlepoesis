### The Increase Puzzle Project
Our group is currently working to convert a sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets into pentomino puzzles. These will be laser cut from wood, acrylic, and other materials, and then assembled as an art-object titled _Increase_. Preparing the puzzles requires finding ways to pack pentomino shapes into a sonnet-shaped frame. Working by hand, we've carved up several sonnets into a set of pentomino pieces, but we hope to do better, enlisting a walk-back algorithm to find all possible solutions to our sequence of sonnets -- that is, all the ways that any given sonnet can be cut up into pentomino shapes.

Our puzzlings continue apace. Meanwhile, we have prototypes to share:
1. [Sonnet 16](../puzzlepoems/sonnet16.html), Neal Curtis
2. ["Ah! Sun-Flower,"](../puzzlepoems/sunflower.html) Brad Pasanek

More puzzle projects forthcoming...
