Note, we have (cut from clear acrylic): a Sonnet 12 sestet, a Sonnet 15 sestet, and a Sonnet 6 sestet.  
We also have a full Sonnet 16, cut from translucent orange acrylic

#### Settings
Words burned on to the acrylic with a Raster setting:  
Raster 60 50 500

Cutting the puzzle has been more of a challenge:  
Cut/Vector at 95 4 500 and make multiple passes, but we're getting some melting/gasesous acrylic messing up the surface.
