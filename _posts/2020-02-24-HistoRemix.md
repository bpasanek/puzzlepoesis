### Humanities Week: Histo-Remix

For IHGCâ€™s [Humanities Week 2020](http://www.hw-uva.com/2020-histo-remix.html), Puzzle Poesis convened a two hour mash-up workshop (featuring the poetry of William Shakespeare, Charlotte Smith, Claude McKay, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Frost, and others). Coffee and cookies were served and hundreds of pentomino puzzle pieces were piled on the tables in Wilson 142.

Our puzzle poets and new friends poured over the pieces and built new macaronic puzzle poems (like the one above). Remix in this context meant experimenting with poetic diction. 

Some poets visiting from Flux wrote original poems into blank puzzle grids. Here's a related effort by Brad Pasanek and Neal Curtis to cast lines of pentameter from various poems into a new 6 x 10 frame.
