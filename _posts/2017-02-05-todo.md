## To-Do List

1. round corners
2. nice underlines
3. image gallery affixed to each page
4. more posts!
5. reconcile "people" -- relation to puzzles and posts, add images, decide what should appear if you click on a person's name
6. what should the home page say?
7. big structure ?'s -- separate contact page? "for educators" space? 
8. general css trudging, like highlighting the current page and adding more colors plus perhaps a "bold," contrasting look
