### Humanities Week: Civil Resistance

For Humanities Week 2018, The Puzzle Poetry group fabricated a large 6' x 10' pentomino-puzzle from the last six lines of Claude McKay's sonnet "Outcast." 

First published by McKay in 1922, the poem speaks to a sense of lost identity. The Harlem Renaissance poet's verses explicitly name the menace of white supremacy. 

At the puzzle event, conceived as a response to the violent events of August 12th, the summer before, students were asked to think about the scale of structural racism, memorials and monuments, and the Reconstruction and the Renaissance.
