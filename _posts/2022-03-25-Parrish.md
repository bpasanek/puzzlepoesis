### Allion Parrish, "Nonsense and Computation"

Puzzle Poetry is pleased to announce that Poet-programmer Allison Parrish is visiting this week: Friday, March 25. She’ll give a craft talk at 1pm and will lead a workshop after (at 2pm). Both events are in Wilson 142.

She’s bringing along a Python routine--all bundled up in an online notebook--that generates nonsense poems. Workshop attendees can run and poke at the code and learn a little about natural language processing. All lit critters and creatives are welcome. Oulipeans, controlled vocabulary poets, and Pythonistas are especially encouraged to attend. No programming knowledge required to participate.

Parrish is an Assistant Professor at NYU Tisch in the Interactive Telecommunications Program. She is the author of Articulations, a book of computer-generated poetry, and the co-creator of the board game Rewordable. Many of her hijinks are collected here: https://www.decontextualize.com
