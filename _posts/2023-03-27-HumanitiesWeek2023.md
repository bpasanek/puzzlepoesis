### Humanities Week 2023, Time Present / Time Past

For IHGC’s [Humanities Week 2023](https://www.hw-uva.com), Puzzle Poesis put on its second annual grounds-wide scavenger hunt of puzzles and riddles. 

![Flyer](../../../../images/CypherHuntFLyer2023.png)

As the Humanities Week theme for this year was “Back to the Present,” we designed the cipher hunt to be accordingly time-oriented. Teams began with a map of the UVa grounds marked with four blank clockfaces, each indicating a location at which a QR code was to be found:

These first four “primary locations” were the Sarah Brown Library, the sundial near the Rotunda stairs, the Circadian Rhythms Lab at Gilmer Hall, and an upstairs alcove in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library. Teams exploring these locations discovered small laminated cards, each numbered and labeled with an apt line from T.S. Eliot’s *Four Quartets*. Upon scanning the QR code at each location, teams then faced a Qualtrics form containing a unique puzzle — each requiring interaction with, or attention to, the immediate environment to solve.

PUZZLE:
>This number of eyes may help you to see  
>Columns well worn yet still anomaly.  
>Look up: divided thus with equal flair  
>A wealth of words will in disguise be there.  
>A vice, an atom, a madness, a roll —  
>Let each be each, although answer with all.

Circadian Rhythms Lab

>PUZZLE:  
>Circadian rhythms cycle up, down,  
>but do not stress, for your clue has been found.  
>Peek at the clock and turn your thoughts to time,  
>up a meter and some feet you will climb —  
>reach hazily into the world of dreams,  
>where the ultimate prize your team redeems.

>SOLUTION:  
>5:10

>Right might be slow  
>Left might be fast   
>But the fastest are right  
>And the slowest get left behind  
>
>SOLUTION:  
>POWER HOUR

Entering the correct answer into the form yielded a time in the form 00:00. Teams then had to discern that in order to progress to the next stage of the hunt, they would have to plot these times onto each respective clockface and extend the minute hands until they intersected, like so (see red lines):

These two intersections on the map thus indicated the next two locations in which QR codes would be found. These two “secondary locations” were the Rotunda Planetarium and the VR Station on the third floor of the Clemons Library.

>PUZZLE:  
>Castor and Pollux may not get to play,  
>Though the rest are all twinned except two.  
>What time is it?
>
>SOLUTION:  
>3:50 (or 10:15)

Virtual Reality

>PUZZLE:  
>Teams donned the headset and played a game involving shadows and the sun in a stonehenge setting in order to arrive at the solution.
>
>SOLUTION:  
>“Time, Real and Imaginary”

Teams then repeated the same procedure as before. In this round, however, inputting the correct answer yielded two times: one, just as before, was unique to each location and was to be plotted onto the map like so (see purple lines):

The other time, however, was the same between the two secondary locations, which in fact indicated when teams were to show up at the final, “tertiary location,” the University Chapel. There, at the appointed time — 1:00pm on the final day of the hunt — members of Puzzle Poesis sat in wait with the final, determining QR code and puzzle based on a piece of music written and performed by a former member of Puzzle Poetry.
