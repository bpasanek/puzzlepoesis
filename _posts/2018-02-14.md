### Let Me Count the Ways

For Valentine's Day, we hoped to convert one of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Sonnets from Portugese into a puzzle.

The complete permutation solution space ("let me count the ways") is 2339 (sestet solutions) x 3,386,001,688 octave solutions (using the 12 pentominos and 5 tetrominos). That's 7,919,857,948,232 possible puzzles (nearly 8 trillion). 

I've got 4 million solutions, but Elizabeth Barrett Browning ain't one.
