### Puzzle, Bots, and Poetics: A Symposium

We are very excited about this event, which has been organized as a two-day conversation about poetics, very broadly construed. It's an emphatically interdisciplinary affair with far-flung scholars from Computer Science (Compton and Veale), English (Bury, Kareem, Sperrazza, and Tenen), and Art History (Rothstein) coming to UVa to talk about constraint, creativity, twitterbots, Oulipo, and puzzles. The assembled talks investigate classical tropes and artifacts (Kareem and Rothstein), early modern making (Sperrazza), form in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Kareem and Tucker), artistic production in Modernism and after (Tenen, Bury, and Rothstein), including the freshly time-stamped offerings of moments ago (Compton, and Veale).
