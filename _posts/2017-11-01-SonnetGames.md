### The Sonnet Games

This tournament brings together undergraduates in the UVa English department's survey courses (ENGL 3810 and 3820) to compete in time trials, racing to reconstruct poems from the  syllabus that our group has piecified. To date, we have staged  three tournaments. We've held these events in Bryan Hall, in Mem Gym, and in Brooks Hall Commons. Just below are images from these first three Games.

Students participate in teams of four â€” which must be cleverly named. (Our favorite team names include Go Big or Go Homer, Merchants of Menace, The Peerless Ploughmen, and It's Getting Hwaet in Here.) The tournament has three rounds of elimination. THe winning team achieves immortal glory but is also gifted books and coffee cards.
