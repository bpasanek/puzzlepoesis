### The Increase Puzzle Project
Our group is currently working to convert a sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets into pentomino puzzles. These will be laser cut from wood, acrylic, and other materials, and then assembled as an art-object titled _Increase_. Preparing the puzzles requires finding ways to pack polyomino shapes into a sonnet-shaped frame. Working by hand, we've carved up several sonnets into a set of pentomino pieces, but we hope to do better, enlisting a walk-back algorithm to find all possible solutions to our sequence of sonnets -- that is, all the ways that any given sonnet can be cut up into pentomino shapes.

To date we've "solved" three sestets, matching Shakespeare's language to polyomino packing puzzles. The sonnets (6, 12, and 15) are the only three of the first seventeen "procreation" sonnets that match solutions to the 6x10 pentomino packing puzzle. The puzzle fits each of the twelve pentomino pieces into the 6x10 rectangle. There are 2,339 solutions to the puzzle.
