Chelsea Li is currently a 2nd year undergraduate hoping to major in English and Human Biology with a minor in Social Entrepreneurship. <!--I am interested in English and Asian literature, sociology, computer programming, and medical research. On-Grounds, I am an editor for the online publication The Rival, part of Student Council's Diversity Engagement Committee, Program Director for a volunteering unit at the hospital, a volunteer EMT with the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad, and a researcher in the Zunder lab for the Biomedical Engineering Department. I am looking forward to laser cutting cool new puzzles and learning other techniques to come up with unique ways to interact with poetry, such as programming online puzzle games.-->
